Description: This package is designed to simulate and analyse species community
    assembly processes. It allows the user to implement different mechanisms of
    community assembly such as environmental filtering, competitive exclusion or
    dispersal limitation. These mechanisms can be combined or activated separately,
    which allows the user to identify biogeographic or phylogenetic patterns
    exclusively correlated with a certain mechanism or combination of mechanisms.
